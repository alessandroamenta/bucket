# Hi, I'm Ale! ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal bucket list app - a little space where I keep track of all the things I want to do in life âœ¨

I built this to remind myself that time is precious (we've all got 4k weeks total if we live to 80! and used up a bunch of them already!), and to be intentional on what I want to do with my time.

## Want to run this locally?

It's super simple:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000`

Made with Next.js and lots of â˜•
